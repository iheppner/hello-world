Simple tutorial repository to get familiar with GitHub.
Cf. https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Testing some Markdown stuff (its obviously not the dialect used by Redmin - its "GitHub Flavored Markdown", cf. https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/)

You can create nested lists by indenting lines by two spaces.

1. Make my changes
  1. Fix bug
  2. Improve formatting
    * Make the headings bigger
2. Push my commits to GitHub
3. Open a pull request
  * Describe my changes
  * Mention all the members of my team
  * Ask for feedback


# Headings1

This is **bold** text

## Headings2

This is *italics* text

### Headings3


#### Headings4

This is ~~strikethrough~~ text

##### Headings5

**This is bold and _italics_ text**

###### Headings6

One can also make some `command` names appear "typewritten".
Or even format snippets of code by beginning a block of code with triple backticks:
```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Number, country FROM worldcitizens GROUP BY country
                                   ORDER BY Number DESC;
```

The following is "Redmine formatting syntax" not valid here (as mentioned above):
```
*Unordered list*:
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
** Sub item 3.1
** Sub item 3.2
** Sub item 3.3
# Item 4

_Ordered list_:
# Item 1
# Item 2
# Item 3
** Sub item 3.1
** Sub item 3.2
** Sub item 3.3
# Item 3

h1. Headings1

h2. Headings2

h3. Headings3
```
